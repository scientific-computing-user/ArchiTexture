# Updated Sources Used

This file is the final evidence map for the revised NeurIPS manuscript in `paper/`. It supersedes the earlier inventory note and reflects the final question-led framing of the paper: frozen SAM is studied through two complementary evidence routes, one over frozen features and one over generated proposal masks, with ControlNet bridge and CAID retained as appendix-side supporting routes.

## Scope lock

Main-paper routes:

- RWTD
- STLD
- feature-space exploration
- proposal-/mask-space exploration via a lightweight learned readout above the frozen mask bank

Appendix-only supporting routes:

- ControlNet-stitched bridge benchmark
- CAID breadth check

Explicitly excluded:

- DeTexture / Detector / ADE20K
